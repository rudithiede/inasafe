"InaSAFE is a plugin for QGIS software. It aims to produce realistic natural "
"hazard impact scenarios for better planning, preparedness and response "
"activities, using hazard and exposure geographic data. A user’s manual "
"developed by Ole Moeller Nielsen and Tim Sutton complements this short "
"training material. During this training, you will explore the different "
"components of InaSAFE plugin and their usage for an easy-to-use risk and "
"impact scenarios assessments. A data sample will be provided with the "
"present material to give you the ability to learn how to manipulate data in "
"InaSAFE, what the requirements of the data are and what kind of results you "
"can expect out of the data."

"InaSAFE is 'n plugin vir QGIS sagteware. Sy doel is om realistiese "
"natuurramp impaksituasies te produseer vir beter beplanning, voorbereiding "
"en reaksie aktiwiteite, deur om van geografiese risiko- en blootstellingdata "
"gebruik te maak. 'n Gebruikershandleiding wat deur Ole Nielsen en Tim Sutton "
"ontwikkel is, komplementeer hierdie kort opleidingshandleiding. Gedurende "
"hierdie opleiding gaan u die verskillende komponente van die InaSAFE plugin, "
"en hulle gebruik vir maklik bruikbare risiko- en impaksituasie assessering, "
"ondersoek en leer ken. 'n Voorbeeld datastel sal verskaf word om u die "
"vermoë te gee om te leer hoe om data in InaSAFE te manipuleer, wat die "
"vereistes van die data is, en hoe die resultate wat u kan verwag, lyk."

"You may be wondering how the InaSAFE plugin determines whether a layer "
"should be listed in the “In the event of” “How many” combo boxes? The plugin "
"relies on simple keyword metadata to be associated with each layer (*The "
"keyword system is described in detail in the user’s manual under Keywords "
"System*). Each layer that has a keyword allocating it’s category to hazard "
"will be listed in the “In the event of” combo. Similarly, a category of "
"exposure in the keywords for a layer will result in it being listed under "
"the “How many” combo. InaSAFE uses the combination of category, subcategory, "
"units and datatype keywords to determine which impact functions will be "
"listed in the “Might” combo."
